# Javascript

### Numbers and Operators.

1. "++" increases the value by 1
2. "+" adds and concats.
3. if we add any number with string, then the number will be converted into strings.
4. If we divide 2 numbers as a string like "10" / "10", then Javascript will convert those strings into numbers. So the result will be 1.same goes for \* and -
5. Nan (Not a Number) : if we do operations like 10+"apple",then result will be NaN.
6. NaN and Infinity are Js reserved keywords, and they are actually Numbers. (typeof NaN is Number).
